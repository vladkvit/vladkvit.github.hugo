<p>I implemented a common real-time shading technique. The code has two ways of computing the specular component, a cosine diffuse component, options for glossiness and for moving the light in 3D space. It's done in Adobe Pixel Bender - I found that I can iterate faster with it as opposed to other shader prototyping platforms. Email me for code.</p>
