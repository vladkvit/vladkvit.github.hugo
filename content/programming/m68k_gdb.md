<p>As part of ECE354, each student had to write a RTOS in a team. The first two weeks of my team's work was getting GDB working with it. Check it out <a href="https://code.google.com/p/coldfire-gdb-stub/">here</a>. We also had other innovations, such as getting it all to properly work on a CPU & chipset emulator, although I didn't work on them as much as I'd like.</p>
