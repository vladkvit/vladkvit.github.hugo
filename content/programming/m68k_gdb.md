As part of ECE354, each student grouped up into a team and wrote a RTOS for the Motorola 68000 CPU / Coldfire board. The first two weeks of my team's work was getting GDB working on the board. Check it out <a href="https://code.google.com/p/coldfire-gdb-stub/">here</a>. It also works with the CPU emulator.
